text="""The dusky dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) is a small oceanic dolphin found in coastal waters of the Southern
 Hemisphere. Major populations occur around South America, southwestern Africa, New Zealand, and several oceanic 
 islands. It has a somewhat stocky body with a short beak, a curved dorsal fin and flippers, and a multi-coloured 
 pigmentation of black, grey, and white. The species prefers cool currents and inshore waters. It lives in a 
 fission–fusion society where groups change size based on social and environmental conditions. The dolphin feeds on 
 several fish and squid species, sometimes using daytime bait ball herding and nightime feeding in deep scattering 
 layers. Mating is polygynandrous – several males will chase after a single female. Young are raised by females in 
 nursery groups. The dusky dolphin is known for its acrobatics, displaying leaping behaviours. It is a popular tourist 
 attraction and the object of whale watching tours."""
